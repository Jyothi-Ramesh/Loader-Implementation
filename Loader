Loader Implementation - Absolute Loader is a critical component of computer systems responsible for 
loading executable programs into memory for execution. This abstract provides an 
overview of the absolute loader, highlighting its purpose, functionality, and 
significance in the realm of computer programming.
The absolute loader acts as an intermediary between the program and the operating 
system, facilitating the smooth loading and execution of programs by resolving 
memory addresses and managing program relocation. Its primary goal is to transform 
the program's binary code into a format suitable for direct execution, thereby 
ensuring efficient and error-free program execution.
This abstract discusses the fundamental functionalities of an absolute loader, which 
include parsing object files, allocating memory, resolving symbolic references, and 
applying necessary relocations. The loader analyzes the object file's structure, 
extracting relevant information such as memory requirements, entry points, and 
external references. By mapping the program's logical addresses to physical memory 
locations, the absolute loader enables the program to access required resources 
during execution.
